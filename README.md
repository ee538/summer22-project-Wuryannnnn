# EE538 Final Project - Summer 2022 - TrojanMap

The project is **optional**: you can select one of the following options:

1. Work on the project and submit the reports.
2. Submit homework assignments (HW4, 5, 6).

If you chose to work on the project, you don't have to submit the remaining homework assignments. Similarly, if you chose to work on the homework assignment, you do not have to submit the project. 

You should inform us of your choice by the first due date (Friday July 8).

#### Who should work on the project?
If you plan to become a software engineer, we recommend to work on the project as it will give you more experience in coding a real life project. Otherwise, you can take the homework assignments.

Not everything in the project is covered in the class. The idea is for you to do some quick research and figure them out. For example, you should read on handling regular expressions in C++.

#### Which one is harder?
We expect both options to take similar amount of time. The project however might require extra effort from you during the environment setup and installing prerequisites.

#### How many students in each team?
Each team should consist of one or two students. You can find team-mates from who are in other sections of the course.  You should select your teammates by the first due date (July 8).

#### What should I submit?
The project is submitted in different phases. You are required to submit the following:

1. Phase 1, 2, and 3: these should be submitted on github.
2. Video presentation: you and your team mate will create a 3-4 minute video, post it as an unlisted video on Youtube and submit the link. The video should include:
   - Teammates introduction
   - Demo of the executable
   - Quick overview of the algorithm and code architecture
   - Tables, plots and comparisons
   - No coding details in the video.

3. Final report in the README file of your github submission. The final report should include the questions that are asked in this README file, your tables and plots for the runtime results, and any other detail of your code.



## Due Dates

- Phase 1: Friday, July 8, 23:59 pm
- Phase 2: Friday, July 15, 23:59 pm
- Phase 3: Friday, July 22, 23:59 pm
- Video Presentation: Friday, July 29, 23:59 pm
- Report: Friday, Aug 5, 23:59 pm


## TrojanMap

This project focuses on using data structures in C++ and implementing various graph algorithms to build a map application.

<p align="center"><img src="img/TrojanMap.png" alt="Trojan" width="500" /></p>

- Please clone the repository, read through [README.md](README.md) and implement the functions of the project.
- Please make sure that your code can run `bazel run` and `bazel test`.
- You need to fill in [trojanmap.cc](src/lib/trojanmap.cc), [mapui.cc](src/lib/mapui.cc) and maybe [mapui.h](src/lib/mapui.h), and add unit tests in the `tests` directory.
- We will use autograder to grade some of the questions

---

## The Data Structure

Each point on the map is represented by the class **Node** shown below and defined in [trojanmap.h](src/lib/trojanmap.h).

```cpp
class Node {
 public:
  Node(){};
  Node(const Node &n) {
    id = n.id;
    lat = n.lat;
    lon = n.lon;
    name = n.name;
    neighbors = n.neighbors;
    attributes = n.attributes;
  };
  std::string id;    // A unique id assign to each point
  double lat;        // Latitude
  double lon;        // Longitude
  std::string name;  // Name of the location. E.g. "Bank of America".
  std::vector<std::string>
      neighbors;  // List of the ids of all neighbor points.
  std::unordered_set<std::string>
      attributes;  // List of the attributes of the location.
};
```

---

## Prerequisites
The details of environment setup will be reviewed in the discussion session. Please do not miss that class!

### External Libraries Installation

For visualization, we use `OpenCV` library. You will use this library as a black box and don't need to worry about the graphic details. Use the following commands to install OpenCV and other libraries.

#### For Macos Users

Step 1. type the following three lines in your terminal
```shell
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install opencv
$ brew install ncurses
```

Step 2.

Check the installation paths of opencv and ncurses by

```shell
brew info opencv
```

and

```shell
brew info ncurses
```

respectively, and update their paths in the `WORKSPACE` file of your project root directory with the actual installation paths



#### For Ubuntu users
Step 1. 
```shell
$ cd **your project folder**
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
$ sudo apt-get install cmake libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config
$ sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
$ cp ubuntu/* ./
```

Step 2. Make sure you set the **path_to_install_folder** to be the absolute path to the **install** folder under opencv when running the following commands

```shell
$ cd opencv/
$ mkdir build install
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=**path_to_install_folder** -D BUILD_LIST=core,highgui,imgcodecs,imgproc,videoio ..
$ make install
```

For example, if cloned this repo under `"/Users/ari/github/TrojanMap"`, you should type:

```shell
$ cd opencv/
$ mkdir build install
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/ari/github/TrojanMap/opencv/install -D BUILD_LIST=core,highgui,imgcodecs,imgproc,videoio ..
$ make install
```

## Run the program

For MacOS users, run

```shell
$ bazel run src/main:main
```

For Ubuntu users, run
               
```shell
$ bazel run --cxxopt='-std=c++17' src/main:main
```

If everything is correct, a menu similar to this will show up.

```shell

## Test The Program

We created some tests for you to test your program, please run
```shell
$ bazel test tests:trojanmap_test
```

Please add you test in the [trojanmap_test_student.cc](tests/trojanmap_test_student.cc) and run

```shell
$ bazel test tests:trojanmap_test_student
```

## Item 1: Autocomplete The Location Name (Phase 1)

```c++
std::vector<std::string> Autocomplete(std::string name);
```

We consider the names of nodes as the locations. Implement a method to type the partial name of the location and return a list of possible locations with partial name as prefix. Please treat uppercase and lower case as the same character.

Example:

Input: "Chi" \
Output: ["Chick-fil-A", "Chipotle", "Chinese Street Food"]

Example:

```shell
**************************************************************
* 1. Autocomplete

```

- What is the runtime of your algorithm? 
It is O(n).
- (Optional) Can you do it faster than `O(n)`?
Using std::find function, should be able to reach O(1) run time.

## Item 2-1: Find the place's coordinates in the Map (Phase 1)

```c++
std::pair<double, double> GetPosition(std::string name);
```

Given a location name, return the latitude and longitude. There are no duplicated location names. You should mark the given locations on the map. If the location does not exist, return (-1, -1). The algorithm is case-sensitive.

Example:

Input: "Target" \
Output: (34.0257016, -118.2843512)

```shell
**************************************************************
* 2. Find the position

**************************************************************
Time taken by function: 1 ms
```

<p align="center"><img src="img/Target.png" alt="Target" width="500"/></p>

## Item 2-2: Check Edit Distance Between Two Location Names (Phase 2)

```c++
int CalculateEditDistance(std::string name1, std::string name2);
```

When entering a location name that does not exist in the map, your program should determine whether the input can be replaced with a "similar name" or not. By "similar names" we mean the names that exist in the map with a *smallest distance* from the original input. 

The distance between two names A and B is the minimum number of operations required to convert A to B. There are 3 operations:
+ Insert a character
+ Delete a character
+ Replace a character

If the exact match is found, it will be shown on the map. Otherwise, the map will show the most similar name by using FindClosestName and print a warning. 

For example, if I type *Rolphs*, I should get a warning like "Did you mean *Ralphs* instead of *Rolphs*?". 

Write a dynamic programming solution to calculate edit distance. 

```c++
std::string FindClosestName(std::string name);
```

Notes:
- Space can be treated like other characters.
- Spell checking part should be case insensitive.

Example:

Input: "Rolphs", "Ralphs" \
Output: 1


In the user interface of your program, you should show the names that have the minimum edit distance to the name that the user entered.

Example:

Input: "Rolphs"\
Output: "Ralphs"

```shell
**************************************************************
* 2. Find the location                                        
**************************************************************

Please input a location:Rolphs
*************************Results******************************
No matched locations.
Did you mean Ralphs instead of Rolphs? [y/n]y
Latitude: 34.0318 Longitude: -118.291
**************************************************************
Time taken by function: 2 ms
```

## Item 3: Get All Categories (Phase 2)

```c++
std::vector<std::string> GetAllCategories();
```

Some of the locations have category types (`attributes` field in `data.csv` file). 

In this section, your program should print all available categories among all existing categories in the map. There should be no duplicates in the output.

## Item 4: Get All Locations In A Category (Phase 2)

```c++
std::pair<double, double> GetAllLocationsFromCategory(std::string category);
```

In this section if the user entries a category, the program prints all locations that match that category. For example, if there is a category called "Grocery", your program should print all locations that match the "Grocery" category. 

## Item 5: Get Locations Using A Regular Expression (Phase 2)

```c++
std::pair<double, double> GetLocationRegex(std::regex location);
```

In this section if the user enters a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), they should see all locations that match that regular expression.

Your program should also verify if the input regular expression was correct.


## Item 6: CalculateShortestPath between two places (Phase 2)

```c++
std::vector<std::string> CalculateShortestPath_Dijkstra(std::string &location1_name,
                                               std::string &location2_name);
std::vector<std::string> CalculateShortestPath_Bellman_Ford(std::string &location1_name,
                                               std::string &location2_name);
```

Given 2 locations A and B, find the best route from A to B. The distance between 2 points is the euclidean distance using latitude and longitude. You should use both Dijkstra algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm. Compare the time for the different methods. Show the routes on the map. If there is no path, please return empty vector.

Please report and compare the time spent by these algorithms.

**You should create a table like below, which includes the runtime of the algorithm for several examples.**

| Point A to Point B      | Dijkstra | Bellman Ford| Bellman Ford optimized|
| -------------------- | ----------- |-------|-----|
|                      |  t1         | t2    |   t3  |

Your table should show have at least 15 rows.

## Item 7: Cycle Detection (Phase 2)

```c++
bool CycleDetection(std::vector<double> &square);
```

In this section, we use a square-shaped subgraph of the original graph by using four coordinates stored in ```std::vector<double> square```, which follows the order of left, right, upper, and lower bounds. 

Then try to determine if there is a cycle path in the that subgraph.
If it does, return true and report the path of the cycle on the map. Otherwise return false.

**Your report should include at least five examples.**

## Item 8: Topological Sort (Phase 2)

```c++
std::vector<std::string> DeliveringTrojan(std::vector<std::string> &location_names,
                                            std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> &dependencies);
```
In this section, we assume that we are using a UAV which means we can fly directly from 1 point to another point. Tommy Trojan got a part-time job from TrojanEats, for which he needs to pick up and deliver food from local restaurants to various location near the campus. Tommy needs to visit a few different location near the campus with certain order, since there are some constraints. For example, he must first get the food from the restaurant before arriving at the delivery point. 

The TrojanEats app will have some instructions about these constraints. So, Tommy asks you to help him figure out the feasible route!

Here we will give you a vector of location names that Tommy needs to visit, and also some dependencies between those locations.


For example, 

```shell
Input: 
location_names = {"Ralphs", "Chick-fil-A", "KFC"}
dependencies = {{"Ralphs","KFC"}, {"Ralphs","Chick-fil-A"}, {"Chick-fil-A", "KFC"}}
```

Here, ```{"Ralphs","KFC"}``` means
that Tommy must go to `Ralphs` prior to `KFC`.

Your output should be:
```shell
Output: Ralphs  -> Chick-fil-A -> KFC
```
Also, we provide ```PlotPointsOrder``` function that can visualize the results on the map. It will plot each location name and also some arrowed lines to demonstrate a feasible route.

If no feasible route exists, you could simply return an empty vector.

Hint:
- You also need to finish ```ReadLocationsFromCSVFile``` and ```ReadDependenciesFromCSVFile``` functions, so you could read and parse data from you own CSV files. We also give two sample CSV files under ```input``` folder, which could be a reference. 
- When it asks you filenames, you need to give the absolute path.
- If you do not have ```ReadLocationsFromCSVFile``` and ```ReadDependenciesFromCSVFile``` functions ready yet, you can just press enter when it asks you filenames. It will call the default locations and dependencies.
- The locations are actually nodes, and the dependencies could be directed edges. You may want to first construct a DAG and then implement topological sort algorithm to get the route.

Note
- **Your report should show several examples of topological sort with at least 5 to 10 nodes.**

## Item 9: The Traveling Trojan Problem (AKA Traveling Salesman!) (Phase 3)

In this section, we assume that we are using a UAV which means we can fly directly from 1 point to another point. Given a vector of location ids, assume every location can reach all other locations in the vector (i.e. assume that the vector of location ids is a complete graph).
Find the shortest route that covers all the locations exactly once and goes back to the start point. 

You will need to return the progress to get the shortest route which will then be converted to an animation.  

We will use the following algorithms:

- Brute-force (i.e. generating all permutations, and returning the minimum)
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravelingTrojan_Brute_force(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```
- Brute-force enhanced with early backtracking
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravelingTrojan_Backtracking(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```
- [2-opt Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt). Also see [this paper](http://cs.indstate.edu/~zeeshan/aman.pdf)
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravelingTrojan_2opt(
      std::vector<std::string> location_ids);
```

We use early backtracking when the current cost is higher than current minimum.

Please report and compare the time spent by these 3 algorithms. 2-opt algorithm may not get the optimal solution. Please show how far your solution is from the optimal solution.

Show the routes on the map. For each intermediate solution, create a new plot. Your final video presentation should include the changes to your solution.

We will randomly select N points in the map and run your program.

## Item 10: Find Nearby (Phase 3)

Given an attribute name `C`, a location name `L` and a number `r` and `k`, find at most `k` locations in attribute `C` on the map near `L`(do not include `L`) with the range of `r` and return a vector of string ids. 

The order of locations should be from
nearest to farthest, and you should not include the current location. 

```c++
std::vector<std::string> TrojanMap::FindNearby(std::string attributesName, std::string name, double r, int k);
```

All attributes:
```
'artwork', 'attraction', 'bakery', 'bank', 'bar', 'beauty', 'beverages', 'bicycle', 'bicycle_rental', 'bus_station', 
'cafe', 'car', 'car_repair', 'car_wash', 'charging_station', 'childcare', 'clinic', 'clothes', 'confectionery',

## Reporting Runtime:
For each menu item, your program should show the time it took to finish each task.

Please make sure to provide various examples when you report the runtime. For example for topological sort, show an example with few nodes and another example with 10 or more nodes. The idea is to see how your runtime grows as input size grows.

## Runtime Comparison
For shortest path algorithms, you should compare solving the same problem with different algorithms (Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford). 
Please show the results on at least 3 different examples.

Similarly for the TSP problem, please provide various examples that show the runtime comparison. In particular, you should show at what point using the exhaustive search is not practical and compare the same input with the heuristic implementation.

**Please provide a table like below that compares the runtime of your algorithms for different number of nodes:**

| Number of nodes      | Time with algorithm 1 | Time with algorithm 2|
| -------------------- | ----------- |----|
|             |  t1        | t2    |

Your table should show have at least 15 rows.

## Report and Rubrics:

Your final project should be checked into Github. The [README.md](README.md) of your project is your report.
